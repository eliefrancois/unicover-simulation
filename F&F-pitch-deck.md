# Unicover: One-Page Pitch Deck

**Financial Peace of Mind for College Applicants**

---

## 🎯 The Problem: $880M in Unprotected Spend

**Every year, 1.1M middle-income families lose $300-500 to college rejections with no safety net.**

- Application fees: **$60-$90/school** | Students apply to **7-10 schools** = **$500-900** in total fees
- Selective acceptance rates: **3-10%** → More applications needed, more rejections inevitable
- **“Missing middle”** ($80K-$200K income): Too rich for fee waivers, not rich enough to shrug off losses
- **Result:** Students cut reach schools from lists. Families absorb losses

**This is a massive market inefficiency with no existing solution.**

## 💡 The Solution: Unicover Reimburses Rejection Fees

**Simple protection product:** Buy a plan → Apply to colleges → Upload rejection letters → Get reimbursed

### Plans & Pricing

| Plan | Price | Schools | Ultra-Elite Max | Max Reimbursement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starter** | $99 | 4 | 1 | $200 |
| **Standard** | $159 | 6 | 2 | $300 |
| **Premium** | $199 | 8 | 3 | $375 |

**Reimbursement:** 50% ultra-selective (<10% admit) | 65% other schools

**Add-on:** Early Coverage (+$25) for ED/EA applications

Plans designed for sustainability while serving families for years, not just one cycle.

## 🐘 yeah, but can this work?

**Concern:** Will adverse selection (high rejection rates/claim rates) destroy profitability?

**Answer:** Extensive simulations prove sustainable margins across realistic scenarios.

*Stress-tested across varying rejection rates to model different degrees of adverse selection:*

| Rejection Rate Scenario | Regular School Rejection Rate | Aggregate Margin | Starter | Standard | Premium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Base Case** (moderate adverse selection) | 30% | **34.4%** | 31.6% | 37.6% | 33.3% |
| **Stress Test** (high adverse selection) | 35% | **28.0%** | 25.2% | 31.3% | 26.7% |
| **Extreme Stress** (worst-case adverse selection) | 40% | **21.5%** | 18.8% | 25.0% | 20.1% |

**Key findings:**
- Profitable across all realistic scenarios, even with significant adverse selection
- Maximum payout caps protect against tail risk, with average payouts consistently well below caps
- Counselor partnerships provide natural adverse selection management through guided school list development (students have better resources → higher likelihood of acceptance)

**Addressing ultra elite schools:** Ultra elite institutions (acceptance rates under ten percent) receive different treatment in our model with lower reimbursement rates and tighter payout caps, reflecting their fundamentally different risk profile. All scenarios above assume 80% ultra elite rejection rates, meaning the stress tests focus on regular school rejection rate variability where the majority of our financial exposure lies. This approach stress-tests the scenarios that would actually drive adverse selection concerns, rather than focusing on ultra elite outcomes where our coverage is deliberately limited.

## 🚀 Business Model

**Monetization:**
- **Primary:** One-time plan purchase (avg $150 blended across tiers)
- **Add-ons:** Early Coverage (+$25), future transfer/grad school cycles
- **Future B2B2C:** School districts, counseling firms, scholarship programs

**Key metrics we’ll track:**
- Rejection rates by school type and acquisition channel
- Claim submission rates and behavioral patterns
- Customer lifetime value across segments
- Counselor partnership performance and retention

## 🤔 “Isn’t This Insurance?”

**The skinny is, No:** Unicover is a pre-paid reimbursement service, not regulated insurance.

✓ Single-cycle product with defined coverage limits

✓ No underwriting or pooled risk transfer

✓ Simple verification: proof of payment + rejection letter

✓ Structured as consumer protection membership

✓ No insurance licensing required

**Fraud protection:** Manual + AI-assisted review maintains integrity while preserving user experience.

## 🔍 okay this seems good, what are you leaving out?

**What we intentionally didn't model:** Several realistic consumer behaviors that would improve margins beyond the projections above.

Our profitability scenarios assume 90% claims rate on all eligible rejections, which represents the most adverse possible outcome. In reality, protection products consistently see lower claims rates due to three well-documented patterns: students admitted to their top choice often don't bother claiming reimbursement for safety school rejections, natural claims friction means some eligible customers never complete the process, and students purchasing multi-school packages may only claim some rejections rather than exhaustively pursuing every eligible dollar.

**Why we excluded these factors:** We wanted to prove the business works under the most conservative assumptions possible. If the model is profitable assuming every customer claims every dollar they're entitled to, then any real-world friction or selective claiming becomes pure margin expansion. This gives us confidence in downside protection while creating multiple levers to improve unit economics once we gather real behavioral data post-launch.

## **TL;DR:**

Our margin projections assume worst-case 90% claims rates. Real-world consumer behavior in protection products consistently shows lower actual claims rates, meaning the profitability numbers above represent a conservative floor with significant upside potential.
